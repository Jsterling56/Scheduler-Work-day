Homework #5 - Work Day Scheduler

# Overview
The purpose of this project was to build a calendar application that lets the user save an event using the HTML and CSS provided. When ran, the application uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It displays the current day and the daytime hours. In the time bloacks, users can enter information that would save to local storage. It is notated in the app whether the hour is in the past, present or future depending on the color of the time block.
